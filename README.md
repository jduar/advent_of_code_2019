This repository mainly contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2019. There is no specific objective other than actually going through the whole event, so don't expect to find the best solutions or the ones with the best performance.

Sometimes I might include code that goes beyond what the problem asks for - for example, I eventually want to change Day 3's solution to include a visualization of the wires and their intersections.

I'd like to use several different programming languages during the event, but I'll default to Python whenever I don't have the time or just don't feel like using something else.
